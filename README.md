# Product_Return_Rate_with_R

# This project is based on the contect of a shoes online shop. 
# It is expected to based on the historical data of customer behaviour
# as well as the characteristics of selected products and 
# the combination of products in current shopping cart,
# the probability of product return can be estimated. 
# This individual case study includes three main parts:

# 1. Create dataset with embodied relationships between 10 selected variables
# 2. Process of statistical learning/data science to find the appropriate model 
#    with logistics regression method as well as study of the impact of sample's size
#    on the quality of estimator
# 3. Study the appropriate complexity of models based on the balance of bias and variance
