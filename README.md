# Product_Return_Rate_with_R

This project is based on the context of a shoes online shop. 
It is expected to base on the historical customer behaviour
as well as the characteristics of selected products and 
the combination of products in current shopping cart,
the probability of product return can be estimated. 
This individual case study includes three main parts:

1. Create dataset with embodied relationships between 10 selected variables

2. Process of statistical learning/data science to find the appropriate model 
   applying logistics regression method as well as study of the impact of sample's size
   on the quality of estimator
   
3. Study the appropriate complexity of models based on the balance of bias and variance

Besides the R code files corresponding to each part of this assignment, there is also 
a report of the whole data generation and study process as well as the visualization of results 
described in german.
